This code creates a scatter plot of the CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level data against the Year column in the df dataframe. It then calculates two lines of best fit: one for the entire dataset (labeled "Fit all" and plotted in red), and one for the data since the year 2000 (labeled "Fit since 2000" and plotted in green).

The linregress function from scipy.stats is used to calculate the slope and intercept of the lines of best fit. The plot function from matplotlib.pyplot is used to add the lines of best fit to the scatter plot.

The xlabel, ylabel, and title functions from matplotlib.pyplot are used to add labels and a title to the plot, and the legend function is used to add a legend with the labels and colors of the lines of best fit.

The fontsize parameter is used to set the font size of the labels and title to 20 and 24, respectively. The legend function is used with a fontsize parameter of 16 to set the font size of the legend labels.

Finally, the plot is saved as sea_level_plot.png and the current axes are returned for testing.
